# LLM Content Creation Rules: Buying Cycle Framework


Compel with content: 
1. For whom? 
2. To do what? 
3. In order to? 
4. By what means? 

The Trigger - the tone of the message - because buying stage determines whether the trigger should be emotional or rational. 
- Content to move prospects/audience from unaware to aware, aware to interested are primarily if not wholly emotional. 
- Messages to move prospects/audience from interested to evaluating and evaluating to purchased are predominately rational. 

3 O's 
3 Act structure: 
1. Obstacle - presents a single problem and/or challenge from the prospects perspective 
2. Outcome - presents the solution. Examples of how its solved 
3. Opprotunity - refocuses the attention on the prospects/audience and provides a single call to action. Only 1 (one) call to action. 


Use these rules to create content appropriately tailored to each stage of the buying cycle:

## STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE INTENDED AUDIENCE

Before creating any content, gather the following information:

**Target Audience Definition:**
- What industry or industries are you targeting?
- What role(s) or job titles are you addressing? (e.g., CFO, Marketing Manager, IT Director)
- What is the company size? (e.g., SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
- What is the geographic location or region?
- What specific pain points or challenges does this audience face?
- What are their goals and aspirations?

**Current Buyer Stage:**
- Which buying cycle stage is this audience in? (Unaware to Aware, Aware to Interested, Interested to Evaluating, or Evaluating to Purchase)
- What behaviors or signals indicate they are in this stage?

**Context and Prior Interactions:**

**Content Objectives:**
