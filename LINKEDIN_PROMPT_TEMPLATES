## Tips for Best Results

### For Better Hooks:
- Start with the most surprising or valuable insight
- Use exact numbers ("grew from 0 to 10,000") not ranges
- Make a claim that seems counterintuitive
- Promise specific value ("Here are 5 things...")

### For Better Body Content:
- Replace "you should" with "I did" 
- Add timestamps ("In month 3...")
- Include failures, not just wins
- Name specific tools, people, or resources

### For Better CTAs:
- Ask a specific question
- Request a specific action (share, follow, comment)
- Make it relevant to the post content
- Keep it simple (one CTA, not three)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: Post feels salesy or corporate
**Fix**: Remove adjectives, use "I" statements, add a small failure or mistake

**Problem**: Hook doesn't grab attention  
**Fix**: Lead with the most surprising result or the biggest mistake

**Problem**: Too long or hard to scan
**Fix**: Cut 30%, add line breaks every 2 sentences, use arrows

**Problem**: Vague or generic
**Fix**: Add specific numbers, names, dates, and concrete examples

**Problem**: No engagement
**Fix**: Ensure CTA asks a question or requests specific action
