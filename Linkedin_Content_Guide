### 3. **Useful**

## Content Elements Checklist

### Hook Requirements (Critical - First 2-3 Lines)
Your hook should include several of these elements:

- **Bold claim**: Make a statement that grabs attention
- **Number**: Include specific data or list size ("7 ways...", "In 3 months...")
- **Credibility**: Establish authority or experience early
- **Get the click**: Make them want to expand the post
- **Create curiosity**: Leave them wanting to know more
- **Highlight gain & loss**: Show what they'll gain or avoid losing
- **Offer easy wins**: Promise quick, actionable value
- **Social proof**: Reference results, testimonials, or validation
- **Make it specific**: Use concrete details, not vague statements
- **Value frame**: Make the benefit crystal clear
- **Pleasure & pain**: Appeal to emotional motivators
- **Get to the punchline quickly**: Don't bury the lead

### Structure & Format

- **Set the stage clearly**: Establish context in the first few lines
- **Short sentences**: Keep most sentences under 20 words
- **Easy to scan**: Use line breaks and white space liberally
- **5th grade writing**: Simple vocabulary and sentence structure
- **Process-oriented**: Show how to do something step-by-step
- **Use arrows**: → or • to create visual breaks and steps

### Content Elements

- **Real examples**: Include specific, concrete examples from experience
- **"Steal my process"**: Share frameworks or step-by-step methods
- **Results**: Include outcomes, metrics, or impacts
- **Takeaway**: Explicitly state the main lesson
- **Summary**: Recap the key points (especially in longer posts)

### Engagement Elements

- **CTA**: End with a call-to-action (share, follow, comment with thoughts)
- **Tag others**: Mention relevant businesses or creators when appropriate
- **Immediately actionable**: Reader should be able to apply this today

### Emotional Resonance (Choose At Least One)

- **Funny**: Use appropriate humor
- **Relatable**: Tap into common experiences
- **Heartfelt**: Show vulnerability or genuine emotion

## LLM Instructions for Content Generation

When creating LinkedIn content, follow this process:

### Step 1: Content Planning
1. Identify the single main point or lesson
2. Determine which emotional angle (funny/relatable/heartfelt) fits best
3. Find a real example or story to illustrate the point
4. Outline the process or framework to share

### Step 2: Hook Creation
Craft a hook that:
- Contains a bold claim or surprising statement
- Includes a specific number when possible
- Establishes credibility quickly
- Creates immediate curiosity
- Can be written in 2-3 short lines

### Step 3: Body Development
Structure the post with:
- Clear stage-setting in lines 4-6
- Main content broken into short, scannable sections
- Real examples with specific details
- Process steps with arrows or bullets
- Concrete results or outcomes

### Step 4: Strong Close
End with:
- A clear takeaway (what they should remember)
- Optional summary if post is long
- Specific CTA (what action you want them to take)

### Step 5: Format Optimization
- Break into 1-2 sentence paragraphs
- Add line breaks for white space
- Use arrows (→) for steps
- Ensure easy scanning
- Check 5th-grade reading level

## Quality Assurance Process

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Burying the lead**: Don't wait until line 10 to make your point
2. **Too many ideas**: One clear point beats three vague ones
3. **Corporate speak**: Write like a human, not a press release
4. **Long paragraphs**: Break up text or readers will scroll past
5. **No examples**: Abstract advice without concrete examples falls flat
6. **Weak hooks**: If the first 3 lines aren't compelling, no one reads further
7. **No CTA**: Always guide readers on what to do next
8. **Too complex**: If it requires a PhD to understand, simplify it

---

## Testing Your Content

### The 3-Second Test
Can someone understand the main point in 3 seconds of scanning? If not, simplify.

### The "So What?" Test
After reading, can the reader answer "So what should I do with this information?" If not, add actionable steps.

### The Voice Test
Read it out loud. Does it sound like how you'd actually talk? If not, make it more conversational.

### The Value Test
Would you be excited to share this with a colleague? If not, increase the value or insights.
