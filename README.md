## 📋 The Four Core Principles

Every LinkedIn post MUST be:

1. **Honest** - Sounds like a real person's real experience

If all four aren't met, the post needs revision.

**Hook** (First 2-3 lines):
- Bold claim that grabs attention
- Specific number for credibility
- Creates curiosity

**Body**:
- Real examples with specifics

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Track which elements work best for your audience:

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. Being too vague (add specific examples)
